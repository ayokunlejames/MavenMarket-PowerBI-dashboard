### Maven Market Power BI Project

# Overview

This Power BI project is my take on the bonus project from the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course by Maven Analytics. The project provides an opportunity to apply Power BI skills using data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The project follows the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report.

## Project Description

# Introduction

This project is based on the Maven Market dataset, provided as a part of the Maven Analytics course. The aim is to simulate a real-world business intelligence scenario, working with data from a grocery chain operating in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The project encompasses various stages of the business intelligence workflow:

1. Connecting and Shaping Data
2. Building a Relational Model
3. Adding Calculated Fields
4. Designing an Interactive Report

# Data Source

The dataset contains information about sales, products, stores, and regions. It includes metrics such as sales revenue, quantity sold, and profit margins, segmented by various dimensions like product category, store location, and time.

# Key Features of the Report

1. Sales Analysis: This section provides insights into total sales, sales by region, and sales trends over time. It helps identify which regions are performing well and which ones need improvement.

2. Product Performance: Analyzes the performance of different product brands, highlighting top-performing products. It also includes metrics like total profit profit margin, total transactions, and return rates.

3. Store Performance: Examines the performance of individual stores across different regions. This includes metrics like total sales, profit margins, return rates, and total transactions.

4. Interactive Filters and Slicers: Allows users to filter data by various dimensions such as date, region, product category, and store. This interactivity enhances the ability to drill down into specific areas of interest.

5. KPIs and Metrics: Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to quickly convey important metrics such as total revenue, total profit, total transactions and returns.

# Steps Taken in the Project

1. Connecting and Shaping the Data:
   - Imported data from multiple sources into Power BI.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Created relationships between different tables to build a coherent data model.

2. Building the Relational Model:
   - Defined relationships between tables based on key fields.
   - Ensured referential integrity and optimized the data model for performance.

3. Adding Calculated Fields:
   - Created calculated columns and measures to enrich the dataset.
   - Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create complex calculations and aggregations.

4. Designing the Interactive Report:
   - Created a visually appealing and user-friendly report layout.
   - Added interactive elements like slicers, filters, and drill-through actions.
   - Ensured the report is responsive and provides meaningful insights at a glance.

# Conclusion

This Power BI project demonstrates the practical application of business intelligence skills learned in the Maven Analytics course. By working through the entire BI workflow with real-world data from Maven Market, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, modeling, and visualization. The final report provides valuable insights into sales, product performance, and store operations, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.
